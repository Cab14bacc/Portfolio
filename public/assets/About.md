## About Me

Hello to anyone visiting my humble online abode! My name is Leo Chen. I'm a second year student studying computer science in Taiwan. Currently doing whatever that springs to mind. My interests are not clear, even to myself.


## About the Website

This website is a practice for web development in general. It's my attempt at my first website using a js framework and different plugins. This short journey of building something that looks better than I expected has been great. Looking forward to making more websites and utilizing this skill to deploy different software services.
